 Contract Design
===================
- amount_min & fee relation
- double transfer
- deadline [?]
- Add third fee (fee_swap_completed, fee_swap_failed, fee_transfer_back)
- Add a 4th fee (failure transfer back)
- Add "owner" to middle state data. (prevents race condition) [locking relayer]

 Relayer
=============
- Dust
	- transfer both [sending to > to_addr]
	- transfer dust to fee collector

 Implementation
====================
- keep in state: dust amount remaining in from_acc
- cleanup instruction

 Bug
====================
- fee_transfer_back (failure case)
- parsed seq from wormhole is wrong (1 offset) [needs coordination with client]
